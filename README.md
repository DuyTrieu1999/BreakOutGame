### Resources Used

Known Bugs:
Collisions between ball and bricks are not perfect. Sometimes, the ball destroys a HIGH BrickType with only a single hit.

Extra credit: None


### Notes
The game has bugs in the collision between the ball and the bricks, specifically when the ball touches the MEDIUM bricks, the ball just destroys the bricks instantly rather than turn them to LOW bricks. Also, when the powerups are activated, sometimes the collisions are not correct.
### Impressions
This project helps me a lot in understanding and implementing different objects and functions that are needed for the game. When making the game, I had to think about how to design the levels so that it's easy to implement new features, as well as to fix bugs. I also learn a lot about javaFX, which would help me with future projects in this class. Overall, the project is a great introduction to the materials and the idea of the class.
